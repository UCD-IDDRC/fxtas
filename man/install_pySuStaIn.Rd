\usage{
install_pySuStaIn(
  envname = "r-pySuStaIn",
  python_version = "<3.10",
  method = "auto",
  pip = TRUE,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{envname}{The name, or full path, of the environment in which Python
packages are to be installed. When \code{NULL} (the default), the active
environment as set by the \code{RETICULATE_PYTHON_ENV} variable will be used;
if that is unset, then the \code{r-reticulate} environment will be used.}

\item{python_version}{The requested Python version. Ignored when attempting
to install with a Python virtual environment.}

\item{method}{Installation method. By default, "auto" automatically finds a
method that will work in the local environment. Change the default to force
a specific installation method. Note that the "virtualenv" method is not
available on Windows.}

\item{pip}{Boolean; use \code{pip} for package installation? This is only relevant
when Conda environments are used, as otherwise packages will be installed
from the Conda repositories.}

\item{...}{
  Arguments passed on to \code{\link[reticulate:py_install]{reticulate::py_install}}
  \describe{
    \item{\code{packages}}{A vector of Python packages to install.}
    \item{\code{conda}}{The path to a \code{conda} executable. Use \code{"auto"} to allow
\code{reticulate} to automatically find an appropriate \code{conda} binary.
See \strong{Finding Conda} and \code{\link[reticulate:conda_binary]{conda_binary()}} for more details.}
    \item{\code{pip_ignore_installed,ignore_installed}}{Boolean; whether pip should
ignore previously installed versions of the requested packages. Setting
this to \code{TRUE} causes pip to install the latest versions of all
dependencies into the requested environment. This ensure that no
dependencies are satisfied by a package that exists either in the site
library or was previously installed from a different--potentially
incompatible--distribution channel. (\code{ignore_installed} is an alias for
\code{pip_ignore_installed}, \code{pip_ignore_installed} takes precedence).}

This function is a wrapper for \link[reticulate:conda-tools]{reticulate::conda_install}.
Its implementation follows the instructions in:

\details{
\subsection{\code{python_version}}{

\code{pySuStaIn} and its dependency \code{kde_ebm} currently (2024-02-14) do not appear to be  with python >= 3.10.
}

\subsection{\code{pip}}{

\code{pip = TRUE} appears to be necessary,
since \code{pySuStaIn} needs to be installed directly from <github.com>
}
