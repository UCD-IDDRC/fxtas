Longitudinal data with more frequent follow-up visits 
would also enable us to answer questions about 
patientsâ€™ responses to receiving FXTAS diagnoses; 
in particular, it would be interesting to observe whether 
anxiety and depressive symptoms increase 
close or shortly following the onset of FXTAS. 
So far, our studies show that anxiety and depressive disorders worsen with age 
and particularly before the onset of FXTAS. [@hagerman2018]
