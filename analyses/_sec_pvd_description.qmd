We visualized the results of Ordinal SuStaIn analysis
using "positional variance diagrams" (PVDs) 
[@fonteijn2011event; @fonteijn2012event].
PVDs are heatmaps with `r events_name` on the y-axis
and sequence positions of events on the x-axis.
Each event is estimated to occur at some point in continuing time
*relative to* other events in sequence.
It should be noted that the exact onset time of each event
cannot be determined by the method we used for this analysis.
The PVD's color scale indicates the Bayesian posterior probability that
a particular event (y-axis)
appears at a particular position along the progression sequence (x-axis).
The different colors (red, blue, magenta, green, purple)
indicate the ordinal levels of symptom progression.
Color intensity represents the Bayesian posterior probability 
of sequence position.
That is, a brighter color indicates a more probable sequence position,
and a paler color indicates a less probable position.

We visualized differences in event sequences by 
sex, 
CGG repeat size, or 
latent subgroup 
using “positional difference graphs” (PDGs). 
PDGs consist of two juxtaposed lists of symptoms in each of two subgroups, 
with each list ordered by most likely sequence position in that subgroup. 
Lines connect the locations of the same symptoms between the subgroups. 
The colors of the connecting lines indicate whether the event occurs at 
an earlier position in the righthand subgroup compared to the lefthand subgroup 
(blue line), 
at a later position (red line), 
or the same position (grey line). 
FXTAS stages are connected by black lines, 
in order to highlight which symptoms occur in different FXTAS stages 
between the two subgroups 
(that is, which symptom lines cross one or more stage lines).
