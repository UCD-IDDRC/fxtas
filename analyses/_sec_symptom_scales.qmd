Parkinson's disease (PD) was defined as 
having a diagnosis of PD prior to the study enrollment. 
The diagnosis of PD was made by the patient's physician or neurologist, 
outside of the study; 
we documented if this diagnosis was made, 
in the medical history section of the study records.

Parkinsonian features were characterized by the presence of 
at least one of the following signs at examination: 
masked facies, 
increased, tone, 
pill-rolling tremor, or 
stiff gait. 
Stiff gait means the individual lacked the normal flow of movement 
and looked stiff but was not spastic.

Tremor severity was assessed using elements of 
the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) 
with scores interpretated as: 
0 = no tremor,
1 = minimal tremor, 
2 = mild tremor noticeable during activities, 
3 = moderate tremor affecting multiple tasks, 
and 4 = severe tremor significantly impairing daily function.

Similarly, ataxia severity was evaluated using 
the International Cooperative Ataxia Rating Scale (ICARS) scoring, 
interpreted as: 
0 = no ataxia, 
1 = slight abnormality, 
2 = moderate abnormality (noticeable but does not interfere significantly),
3 = marked impairment (function slightly affected), and 
4 = severe impairment (complete inability to perform the task) [@Berry-KravisElizabeth2003Taai].
