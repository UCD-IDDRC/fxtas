Using the FXTAS Stage transitions as reference points,
we explored the differences in the appearing symptoms
relative to these FXTAS Stage transitions.
Roughly speaking:
Subtype 1 appeared to experience
white matter disease phenotypes earlier 
(before FXTAS Stage 1)
compared to the other subtypes.
Subtype 2 appeared to experience 
early intermittent tremors and intention tremors 
(before FXTAS Stage 1).
Subtype 3 appeared to experience
early ataxia onset
(between FXTAS Stages 1 and 2)
and tremor onsets
(between FXTAS Stages 1 and 3).
Subtype 4

Subtype 3 appeared to experience early ataxia 
(between FXTAS Stages 1 and 2).
Subtypes 1 and 2 
who only showed MRI abnormalities 
ataxia between Stages 2 and 3,
head tremors between Stages 3 and 4,
parkinsonian features between Stages 3 and 4,
and white matter disease between Stages 4 and 5.
Compared to Subtype 1, Subtype 2 appeared to experience
white matter disease phenotypes earlier (between Stages 2 and 4),
memory impairment (assessed by SWM) earlier (Stage 3-4 versus 4-5),
and psychiatric disorders later (between Stages 3 and 5).
Subtype 2 might be described as "memory-early".
Subtype 3 appeared to experience
white matter disease phenotypes early (between Stages 1 and 3),
and mood disorders late (Stages 4-5).
Subtype 4 had the fewest participants and was difficult to interpret.
It may represent a mixture of smaller latent subtypes and/or
include outlier individuals with unusual event sequences.
