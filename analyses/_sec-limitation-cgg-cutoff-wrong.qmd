When we compared
between 55-99 vs 100-200 CGG repeats in males and females combined,
no significant difference was found
(p = `r pval_cgg_gp34_v1`)
(@suppfig-pvd-by-cgg).
The finding of only minimal differences
between 55-99 vs 100-200 CGG repeats is surprising,
since several studies have found that the higher the CGG repeats,
the earlier the onset and the faster the progression of FXTAS
[@greco2006neuropathology; @leehey2008fmr1; @tassone2023insight].
Perhaps the cut-off of 100 is too high for this distinction to be made.
