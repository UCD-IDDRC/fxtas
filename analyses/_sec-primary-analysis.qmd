The primary sequence analysis of symptomatic events
included baseline visit data
from `r nrow(v1_usable)` participants from the GP and TRAX cohorts,
consisting of
`r nrow(v1_usable_cases)` premutation carriers and
`r nrow(controls_v1)` controls.
@tbl-demographics provides
demographic information about the study participants.
Data from unaffected control participants were used to estimate
the distribution of the analyzed `r outcomes_name`s
among non-FXTAS individuals
as reference in SuStaIn modeling
(more details in section [Ordinal SuStaIn model](#sec-scored-events-model)).
Then the cases' data were used to estimate FXTAS event sequences,
using the estimated control distributions to account for random variation
in observed symptoms unrelated to the underlying event sequence.
