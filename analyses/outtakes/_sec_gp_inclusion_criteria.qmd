This study was conducted at the 
University of California, Davis MIND Institute 
and was supported by an NIH (NICHD) grant (R01HD036071; PI Hagerman). 
Most participants were recruited 
through the Fragile X Research and Treatment Center 
at the MIND Institute, 
including 
both family members 
already engaged with our clinical and research programs,
and new families who contacted us for 
clinical services 
or information about our research.
Participants in the following categories were included:

1.	Premutation carriers with intellectual disabilities (IQ < 80) 
or a diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder (ASD)
(Autism, PDD-NOS, or Aspergerâ€™s syndrome).
2.	Premutation carriers without intellectual disabilities or ASD.
3.	Adult premutation carriers who have neurological symptoms or have been diagnosed with FXTAS.
4.	Control individuals without the fragile X premutation.

GP study participants with neurological symptoms or FXTAS
are reassessed every two years
to document phenotypic progression over time.
