Females were more likely to be classified in latent subtype 2 (39% versus 24%),
whereas males dominated in subtype 3 (29% versus 12%).
Subtypes 1 and 4 were equally prevalent among men and women.
We did not find statistically significant evidence of
differences in subtype distributions between CGG < 100 versus â‰¥ 100.
