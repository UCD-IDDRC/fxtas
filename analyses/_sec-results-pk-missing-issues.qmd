@tbl-demographics describes summary statistics of patient characteristics
included in the analysis.
Our data included:
`r nrow(v1_usable_cases)` fragile X premutation carriers and
`r nrow(controls_v1)` controls;
`r nrow(v1_usable_males)` males and `r nrow(v1_usable_females)` females;
and `r and::and(stages)` carriers at
FXTAS stages `r names(stages) |> and::and()`, respectively.
`r pct_stage_3plus`% of premutation carriers were at FXTAS Stages 3-5
at the time of their baseline visit (Table 1).
`r pct_pf_stage3plus["3+", "Yes"]`% 
of premutation carriers at FXTAS Stages 3-5 had parkinsonian features,
while `r pct_pf_stage3plus["0-2", "Yes"]`% 
of premutation carriers at FXTAS Stages 0-2 had parkinsonian features
(@supptbl-stage-vs-pk-ft).
Note that an estimated 
`r parkinsons_female_pct`% of female premutation carriers 
had Parkinsons Disease,
whereas only `r pf_female_pct`% of female premutation carriers
had parkinsonian features (@supptbl-parkinsons-by-cgg).
The apparent discrepancy is due to different proportions of missing data;
`r parkinsons_na_pct`% of the “Parkinson's disease” variable is missing,
whereas `r pf_na_pct`% of the “parkinsonian features” variable is missing.
Parkinson's disease diagnoses were made by
the participants’ primary physicians or neurologists,
outside of the GP and TRAX studies,
whereas parkinsonian features were assessed as part of the study protocols.
All nine participants with recorded Parkinsons Disease diagnoses
also had at least one parkinsonian feature.
