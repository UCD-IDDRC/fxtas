Research participants were recruited between `r min_year` and `r max_year`
for two longitudinal cohorts:
the Genotype-Phenotype Study in Fragile X Families
("GP"; funded by NICHD R01HD036071; PI Hagerman) and
the Trajectories and Markers of Neurodegeneration
in Fragile X Premutation Carriers study
("TRAX"; funded by NINDS NS110100; PIs Hessl and Rivera)
conducted at the University of California, Davis MIND Institute.
A written informed consent form was obtained from all participants 
according to the procedures approved by the 
University of California, Davis Institutional Review Board.

The GP longitudinal study is an ongoing effort 
focused on adult male and female 
carriers of the *FMR1* premutation who 
present with neurological problems that do not meet diagnostic criteria of FXTAS 
or have been diagnosed with FXTAS,
and healthy control individuals without the fragile X premutation,
aged 40-85 at entry,
with follow-up visits approximately every two years.
For those carriers diagnosed with FXTAS at the entry, 
their historical symptoms were retrospectively collected and recorded.

The TRAX longitudinal study is an ongoing effort studying 
adult male premutation carriers 
ranging from 40-82 years
and male healthy controls 
ages 40-75 at baseline visit. 
The TRAX participants return for follow up visits 
with varying intervals between visits averaging 2.5 years
to assess phenotypic progression over time.
