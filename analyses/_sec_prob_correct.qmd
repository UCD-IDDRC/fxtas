**Percentages of controls at baseline levels, 
and corresponding estimates of 
probability of correct scoring.**
All controls are assumed to be truly 
at the reference levels for each symptom, 
and the percentage of correctly scored individuals 
is thus estimated as 
the percentage of controls 
who were assessed as being 
at the reference level.
