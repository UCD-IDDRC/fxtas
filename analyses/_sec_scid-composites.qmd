Similarly, we combined individual SCID disorders into composite variables,
taking the highest level ("Absent", "Sub-Threshold", or "Threshold")
among the constituent individual disorders.

- "SCID: mood disorders" combines:
Bipolar I Disorder (MD01), Lifetime,
Bipolar II Disorder (MD02), Lifetime,
Other Bipolar Disorder (MD03), Lifetime,
Major Depressive Disorder (MD04), Lifetime,
Dysthymic Disorder (MD05), Lifetime,
Depressive Disorder NOS (MD06), Lifetime,
Mood Disorder Due to GMC (MD07), Lifetime,
Substance-Induced Mood Dis. (MD08), Lifetime.

- "SCID: substance use disorders" combines
Alcohol (SUD17), Lifetime,
Sedative-Hypnotic-Anxiolytic (SUD18), Lifetime,
Cannabis (SUD19), Lifetime,
Stimulants (SUD20), Lifetime,
Opioid (SUD21), Lifetime,
Cocaine (SUD22), Lifetime,
Hallucinogenics/ PCP (SUD23), Lifetime,
Poly Drug (SUD24), Lifetime,
Other (SUD25), Lifetime.

- "SCID: anxiety disorders" combines
Panic Disorder (ANX26), Lifetime,
Agoraphobia without Panic (ANX27), Lifetime,
Social Phobia (ANX28), Lifetime,
Specific Phobia (ANX29), Lifetime,
Obsessive Compulsive (ANX30), Lifetime,
Posttraumatic Stress (ANX31), Lifetime,
Generalized Anxiety (ANX32), Current Only,
Anxiety Due to GMC (ANX33), Lifetime,
Substance-Induced Anxiety (ANX34), Lifetime,
Anxiety Disorder NOS (ANX35), Lifetime.
Note that in the SCID-I/NP for DSM-IV, for generalized anxiety,
only the current, not lifetime prevalence, is included.

- "SCID: somatoform disorders" combines
Somatization Disorder (SOM36),
Pain Disorder (SOM37),
Undifferentiated Somatoform (SOM38),
Body Dysmorphic (SOM40),
Hypochondriasis (SOM39).

- "SCID: psychotic symptoms" consists of only Primary Psychotic Symptoms (PS01), Lifetime.

We then combined the "Absent" and "Sub-Threshold" levels
in order to reduce the number of stages in the model,
due to our limited sample size 
(as described in the main text, @sec-outcome-vars),
and since very relatively participants had composite SCID variables
at the sub-threshold levels (@supptbl-scid).

@supptbl-mood-disorders shows contingency tables 
for the individual SCID items included in the
"mood disorders" composite variable.
Most participants with mood disorders had Major Depressive Disorder (MD04);
a few had bipolar disorders (MD01, MD02, MD03).
