We created a composite variable named "any autoimmune disorder" combining
systemic lupus erythematosus,
rheumatoid arthritis,
multiple sclerosis,
positive anti-nuclear antibody (ANA),
Sjogren's syndrome,
and
Raynaud's syndrome,
since these conditions were too rare to analyze separately
(details in Supplementary material,
[Any autoimmune disorder](#sec-any-autoimmune)).
We also created composite variables for four domains of
the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID-IV):
mood disorders,
substance use disorders,
anxiety disorders, and
somatoform disorders;
there were no participants with psychotic disorders in our data
(more details in Supplementary material,
[SCID composite variables](#sec-SCID-composites)).
We also created composite variables for
MRI variables for cerebral and cerebellar abnormalities;
we did not combine the variables representing
corpus callosum MRI abnormalities,
since these variables were created using
Likert scales that differed from each other
(details in Supplementary material, [MRI variables](#sec-MRI-composites)).
For the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB)
variables, we used categorization cutoffs taken from Talebi et al 2020
[@talebi2020cambridge].

The developers of the Ordinal SuStaIn algorithm
recommend a minimum of three observations per
symptom level [@young2021ordinal].
In order to limit the number of symptom levels
with extremely rare observations in our models,
we combined the “Moderate” and “Severe” levels for the MRI variables
and the “Absent” and “Sub-Threshold” levels for the SCID domain variables.

Supplementary Tables [-@supptbl-tremors] - [-@supptbl-autoimmune]
summarize each of the `r outcomes_name`s
that we included in the analysis models,
stratified by
CGG repeat size (`r levels(v1_usable$"FX3*")`)
and
sex.
