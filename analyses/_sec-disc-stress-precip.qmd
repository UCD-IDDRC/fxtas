Others have written about
early executive function (EF) and possibly memory problems
in females with the premutation
who are asymptomatic for the motor features of FXTAS [@loesch2024].
In addition, Hessl et al., 2023 [@hessl2023]
found that the Metacognition Index,
which includes working memory and other EF measures,
were significantly worse than controls in male carriers
before the onset of FXTAS.
As noted above,
the psychiatric co-morbidities such as anxiety and depressive disorders
can intensify before the onset of FXTAS in female carriers.
