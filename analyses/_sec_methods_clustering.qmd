We also fitted the model on the full dataset (not stratified by sex or CGG)
for 2 - `r N_S_max` latent subtypes,
each with their own ordering.
We determined the optimal number of latent subtypes for this dataset using
the Cross-Validation Information Criterion (CVIC)
and the Out-Of-Fold Log-Likelihood (OOFLL) criterion [@young2018uncovering];
both criteria quantify how well models containing a given number of subtypes
extend to new data not used in training.
We performed `r N_CV_folds`-fold cross-validation on the unstratified data
and calculated the CVIC and OOFLL for 1-`r N_S_max` latent subtypes.
We selected an optimal number of latent subtypes based on 
a combination of these metrics and the principle of parsimony (“Occam’s razor”). 
Once we determined the optimal number of latent subtypes, 
we classified each individual into their most likely subtype 
and investigated distributional differences of sex and CGG repeat size 
between the subtypes (@tbl-sg_demos).
