This new graph reveals that 
many of the females have not yet experienced any of the analyzed FXTAS symptoms. 
This finding may reflect that 
some females are less affected by some symptoms we studied, 
such as tremor and ataxia, because a second X chromosome 
which is unaffected is protective in females. 
This result supports our finding that 
the diagnostic criteria for FXTAS applies well for males 
but not so well for females, 
and it underscores the need to develop 
sex-specific diagnostic criteria for FXTAS and FXTAS stage.
