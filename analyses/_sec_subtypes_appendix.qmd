In order to use the Ordinal SuStaIn modeling algorithm, 
we must specify how many latent subtypes to include in the model. 
There are several metrics for determining 
the optimal number of subtypes for a given data set, 
including the likelihood of the data for the fitted model 
while varying the number of subtypes used to fit the model
and the Cross-Validation Information Criterion (CVIC)
described in Young *et al.* [-@young2018uncovering].
We also evaluated the consistency of our cross-validation procedure
by looking at the distribution of 
out-of-fold log-likelihood ("OOFLL")
across cross-validation folds
(Young *et al.* [-@young2018uncovering]).
@suppfig-mcmc-loglik shows the distribution of log-likelihoods 
from the MCMC samples for the full dataset 
(not stratified by sex or CGG repeats).
Adding up to 6 clusters substantially improves the log-likelihood.
[Supplementary Fig. @fig-cvic-2] shows 
the distribution of the OOFLL statistic
as a function of number of latent subgroups.
@suppfig-stage-by-age shows estimated disease progression stage
(that is, number of events experienced)
by age at visit and estimated latent subtype,
with a
Locally Estimated Scatterplot Smoothing (LOESS)
non-parametric regression curve superimposed [@cleveland1992local].
This graph is a model diagnostic; if the model fits the data well,
then older patients should on average be classified as being farther
along in their disease progression, resulting in an upwards trend.
Types 1, 3 and 4 appear to show such an upwards trend.
Type 2 has a less clear trend, but does not show substantial evidence
of lack of fit.
In all four subtypes, patients whose visit occurred at a later age
tend to be at a later estimated stage of disease progression.
The upwards trend of progression stage with age
indicates that the estimated models are plausible.
