The Ordinal SuStaIn algorithm clusters observations into subgroups
based on their shared compatibility with particular event sequences.
As a simplified example,
if participants A, B, and C all had experienced ataxia but no tremors
by the time when they were assessed for the study,
and participants D, E, and F had all experienced tremors but not ataxia,
then participants A, B, and C would be grouped as a subgroup cluster
in which ataxia precedes tremor,
and participants D, E, and F would be clustered into
a “tremor before ataxia” subgroup.
If participants G, H, and I displayed
both ataxia and tremors at the time of assessment,
then the Ordinal SuStaIn algorithm might be
unable to confidently determine which latent subgroup they belonged to,
at least on the basis of these two symptoms.
However, their other symptoms help the algorithm refine the clustering.
On the other hand,
if participants J, K, and L displayed neither ataxia nor tremors,
they would also not be classified into
either of the two clusters described above
and would be assigned to a new cluster “Subgroup 0”,
representing individuals whose disease has not yet begun to progress
by the time when they were assessed for the study.

To cluster observations in a given data set into latent subtypes
using the Ordinal SuStaIn modeling algorithm,
we choose the optimal number of clusters based on cross-validation metrics.
Those metrics include
the likelihood of the data for the fitted model
while varying the number of subtypes used to fit the model
and the Cross-Validation Information Criterion (CVIC)
described in Young *et al.* [-@young2018uncovering].
We also evaluated the consistency of our cross-validation procedure
by looking at the distribution of
out-of-fold log-likelihood ("OOFLL")
across cross-validation folds
(Young *et al.* [-@young2018uncovering]).
@suppfig-mcmc-loglik shows the distribution of log-likelihoods
from the MCMC samples for the full dataset
(not stratified by sex or CGG repeats).
Adding up to 6 clusters substantially improves the log-likelihood.
[Supplementary Fig. @fig-cvic-2] shows
the distribution of the OOFLL statistic
as a function of number of latent subgroups.
@suppfig-stage-by-age shows estimated disease progression stage
(that is, number of events experienced)
by age at visit and estimated latent subtype,
with a
Locally Estimated Scatterplot Smoothing (LOESS)
non-parametric regression curve superimposed [@cleveland1992local].
This graph is a model diagnostic; if the model fits the data well,
then older patients should on average be classified as being farther
along in their disease progression, resulting in an upwards trend.
Types 1, 3 and 4 appear to show such an upwards trend.
Type 2 has a less clear trend, but does not show substantial evidence
of lack of fit.
In all four subtypes, patients whose visit occurred at a later age
tend to be at a later estimated stage of disease progression.
The upwards trend of progression stage with age
indicates that the estimated models are plausible.
