We analyzed measurements of 
`r length(biomarker_levels)` ordinal `r outcomes_name`s,
each with 
between two and `r max_levels |> xfun::numbers_to_words()` levels, 
listed in @tbl-biomarker-list.
Herein the term "`r outcomes_name`s" refers to 
a broad range of medical signs 
or indications of medical state 
observed from patients.
Each "clinically elevated" ordinal level 
(above the first-listed, reference level) 
constitutes an outcome event 
in the disease progression modelling analysis 
(see [Statistical analysis](#sec-Statistical-analysis)).

We created a composite variable named "any autoimmune disorder" combining
systemic lupus erythematosus, 
rheumatoid arthritis, 
multiple sclerosis, 
anti-nuclear antibody (ANA) positivity, 
Sjogren's syndrome, 
Raynaud's syndrome, 
and pulmonary fibrosis, 
since these conditions were too rare to analyze separately
(details in Supplementary material, [Any autoimmune disorder](#sec-any-autoimmune)).
We also created composite variables for four domains of 
the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID-IV):
mood disorders, 
substance use disorders, 
anxiety disorders, and 
somatoform disorders;
there were no participants with psychotic disorders in our data
(more details in Supplementary material, [SCID composite variables](#sec-SCID-composites)).
We also created composite variables for 
MRI variables for cerebral and cerebellar abnormalities;
we did not combine the variables representing 
corpus callosum MRI abnormalities,
since these variables were created using Likert scales that differed from each other
(details in Supplementary material, [MRI variables](#sec-MRI-composites)).
For the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB) 
variables, we used categorization cutoffs taken from Talebi et al 2020
[@talebi2020cambridge].

Supplementary Tables [-@supptbl-tremors] - [-@supptbl-autoimmune] 
summarize each of the `r outcomes_name`s that we included in the analysis models, 
stratified by 
CGG repeat size (`r levels(v1_usable$"FX3*")`) 
and 
sex.
