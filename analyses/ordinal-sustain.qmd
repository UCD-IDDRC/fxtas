@tbl-demographics describes summary statistics of patient characteristics 
included in the analysis. 
Our data included: 
`r nrow(v1_usable_cases)` fragile X premutation carriers and 
`r nrow(controls_v1)` controls;
`r nrow(v1_usable_males)` males and `r nrow(v1_usable_females)` females;
and `r and::and(stages)` carriers at 
FXTAS stages `r names(stages) |> and::and()`, respectively. 
We found no differences between males and females in 
age at baseline visit, 
ethnicity/race, 
FXTAS stage, or
CGG repeat length.
@tbl-biomarker-list lists the `r outcomes_name`s and their ordinal levels
and reports percentages of clinically elevated levels at baseline visit, 
stratified by sex.
We found significant sex differences in 
percentages of clinically elevated (non-reference) 
`r outcomes_name` levels 
at baseline visit for `r report_sex_differences(biomarkers_table)`.

## Sex differences in sequential orders {#sec-methods-strat-sex}

#| label: p-val-test-sex

permuted_test_stats <- collect_permutation_test_stats(
  output_folder = output_folder,
  permuting_variables = "Gender"
)

observed_test_stat <- get_observed_permutation_test_stat(
  output_folder,
  dataset_names = c("females", "males")
)

pval_sex_gp34_v1 <- permutation_test(
  observed_test_stat = observed_test_stat,
  permuted_test_stats = permuted_test_stats,
  n_permutations = n_permutations
)
```

@fig-first-only-pvd shows 
the estimated sequential orders
of FXTAS `r outcomes_name`s 
in males and females, 
and @fig-first-only-diffs shows differences in those orders.
We found statistically significant evidence of a 
difference in sequences of `r events_name`
between males and females (p = `r pval_sex_gp34_v1`). 
It appears that 
female premutation carriers developed 
SCID mood disorder symptoms, 
both sub-threshold-level and threshold-level,
prior to FXTAS Stage 1 diagnosis,
whereas male carriers experienced these symptoms much later 
(often between FXTAS Stages 3 and 4) (@fig-first-only-diffs).
Ataxia occurred prior to Stage 1 for females 
and after Stage 2 for males.
However, ataxia severity level 1 occurred 
earlier for males (between Stages 2-3) 
than for females (between Stages 3-4).
Advanced degrees of ataxia severity also occurred 
earlier in the event sequence for males than females. 
MRI biomarkers of decline and parkinsonian features 
also appear to begin at earlier FXTAS stages for males than for females.

)
```

When we conducted subgroup analyses by CGG repeat size,
we found statistically significant evidence of 
a difference between males and females
among those with CGG < 100 (p = `r pval_under100_sex_gp34_v1`)
(@suppfig-pvd-by-gender-cgg_under100).
Several psychiatric disorders (as assessed by SCID) 
occurred prior to FXTAS Stage 1
among females with CGG < 100,
but at later FXTAS stages for males with CGG < 100.
MRI biomarkers appeared to occur at later stages in females compared to males.
We did not find statistically significant evidence of 
a difference between males and females
among those with CGG ≥ 100 (p = `r pval_over100_sex_gp34_v1`) 
(@suppfig-pvd-by-gender-cgg_over100).


```{r}
#| label: p-val-test-cgg-male

permuted_test_stats <- collect_permutation_test_stats(
  output_folder = output_folder,
  stratifying_levels = "Male",
  permuting_variables = "FX3"
)

observed_test_stat <- get_observed_permutation_test_stat(
  output_folder,
  dataset_names = c("under100_Male", "over100_Male")
)

pval_male_cgg_gp34_v1 <- permutation_test(
  observed_test_stat = observed_test_stat,
  permuted_test_stats = permuted_test_stats,
  n_permutations = n_permutations
)
```


```{r}
#| label: p-val-test-cgg-female

permuted_test_stats <- collect_permutation_test_stats(
  output_folder = output_folder,
  stratifying_levels = "Female",
  permuting_variables = "FX3"

observed_test_stat <- get_observed_permutation_test_stat(

  dataset_names = c("under100_Female", "over100_Female")
)

pval_female_cgg_gp34_v1 <- permutation_test(
  observed_test_stat = observed_test_stat,
  permuted_test_stats = permuted_test_stats,
  n_permutations = n_permutations
)

n_over_100_female <-
  v1_usable |>
  dplyr::filter(
    Gender == "Female",
    CGG >= 100
  ) |>
  nrow()
```

We found significant evidence of an overall difference between CGG <100
and CGG ≥100 among males (p = `r pval_male_cgg_gp34_v1`) 
(@suppfig-pvd-by-cgg-male). 
SWM between errors occurred prior to Stage 1 in males with CGG repeats <100, 
whereas it occurred between stage 3 and 4 
in males with CGG repeats ≥ 100 
([Supplementary Fig. @fig-pvd-by-cgg-male-2]). 
Postural, 
resting, 
and intermittent tremor 
occurred in earlier FXTAS stages in those with CGG repeats <100 
compared to those with CGG repeats ≥100.
Several psychiatric disorders (as measured by SCID) 
occurred later in the event sequence in participants with CGG repeats <100 
compared to those with CGG repeats ≥100.  
However, we did not find a significant difference between CGG <100 and CGG ≥100 
among females (p = `r pval_female_cgg_gp34_v1`) 
(@suppfig-pvd-by-cgg-female). 
It should be noted that this comparison lacked statistical power 
given the limited sample size of only `r n_over_100_female` females with CGG ≥100.

## Subtype clustering

```{r}
#| label: set-optimal-subtypes
temp <- sustain_output |> attr("CV")
n_s_min_CVIC <- which.min(temp$CVIC) # nolint: object_name_linter
n_s_selected <- 4

results_cv_max <- extract_results_from_pickle(
  n_s = n_s_selected,
  use_rds = use_rds,
  dataset_name = dataset_name,
  output_folder = output_folder
)
```

We conducted latent subtype classification analysis to cluster participants 
that are relatively homogeneous within the same cluster 
and heterogeneous from other clusters 
based on similarities and difference in sequential patterns. 
Based on the CVIC criterion (Supplementary material, [Detecting latent subtypes](#sec-subtypes)), 
`r n_s_min_CVIC` subtypes were suggested to be the optimal number for the full, 
unstratified dataset 
([Supplementary Fig. @fig-cvic-1]). 
The out-of-fold log-likelihood ("OOFLL") (Supplementary material, [Detecting latent subtypes](#sec-subtypes)) 
showed substantial fold-to-fold variation 
([Supplementary Fig. @fig-cvic-2]).
Between `r broman::spell_out(n_s_selected)` and `r broman::spell_out(N_S_max)` 
latent subgroups, 
the distribution of OOFLL appears to be
approximately unchanging and the CVIC appears approximately flat, 
and thus for easier clinical interpretation
and in consideration of the principle of parsimony, 
we chose to classify participants into `r n_s_selected` subtypes.
The subtypes are numbered 1-4 in order of estimated relative frequency
(that is, in order of how many participants were clustered into each subtype).

```{r}
#| label: compute-n-in-subtype-0
n_type_0 <- results_cv_max$subtype_and_stage_table |>
  dplyr::filter(ml_subtype == "Type 0") |>
  nrow()
```

@suppfig-pvd_chosen_subtypes shows the estimated sequential event orders
for each of the subtype clusters.
@suppfig-pvd_chosen_subtypes_linegraphs shows 
differences in event sequences between subtypes. 
@tbl-sg_demos shows 
the demographics of the patients clustered in each subtype. 
`r n_type_0 |> xfun::numbers_to_words() |> Hmisc::capitalize()` 
patients had experienced too few events 
to be accurately classified into a subtype 
and were excluded from @tbl-sg_demos.
Subtype clustering analysis showed that 
subtypes were mainly classified by sex and CGG repeat size, 
supporting the results above. 
Subtype 1 appeared more biased towards males (65.1%) 
and lower CGG repeat size (83.2 ± 15.8) 
compared to the overall study population 
(64.5% of males; CGG repeat size = 87.3  ± 18.9) and other subtypes; 
Subtype 2 appeared biased towards females (53.1% of males) 
and higher CGG repeat size (90.2 ± 22.3); 
Subtype 3 appeared over-represented by males (82% of males) 
and high CGG repeat size (92.4 ± 17.4); 
and Subtype 4 was biased towards females (60% of males) 
and lower CGG repeat (82.7 ± 17.3). 

```{r}
#| label: get-n-events
n_events <- nrow(biomarker_events_table)
```

Using the FXTAS Stage transitions as reference points,
we examined the differences in the appearing symptoms
relative to these FXTAS Stage transitions.
Roughly speaking:
Subtype 1 appeared to experience 
early mood disorders (before FXTAS Stage 1),
ataxia between Stages 2 and 3,
head tremors between Stages 3 and 4,
parkinsonian features between Stages 3 and 4,
and white matter disease between Stages 4 and 5.
Compared to Subtype 1, Subtype 2 appeared to experience 
white matter disease phenotypes earlier (between Stages 2 and 4),
memory impairment (assessed by SWM) earlier (Stage 3-4 versus 4-5),
and psychiatric disorders later (between Stages 3 and 5).
Subtype 2 might be described as "memory-early".
Subtype 3 appeared to experience
white matter disease phenotypes early (between Stages 1 and 3),
and mood disorders late (Stages 4-5).
Subtype 4 had the fewest participants and was difficult to interpret.
It may represent a mixture of smaller latent subtypes and/or
include outlier individuals with unusual event sequences.
