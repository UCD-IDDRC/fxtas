The permutation test approach 
for comparing the stratified models between subpopulations 
is a widely used inference technique, 
a desired method particularly when the true null distribution is unknown. 
The permutation test approach is based on 
the empirical sampling distribution of its own data 
to calculate a test statistic and its respective p-value. 
Its performance in this application could be validated 
either mathematically or through simulations.
