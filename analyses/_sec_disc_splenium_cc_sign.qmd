Although no neuropathological studies have examined 
the splenium of the corpus callosum (CCS), 
several *in vivo* MRI studies have reported 
signal changes in the CCS in patients with FXTAS. 
Apartis et al., 2012 [@apartis2012fxtas] 
was the first study reporting that CCS hyperintensity occurred 
as frequently as middle cerebellar peduncle (MCP) hyperintensity 
in 22 patients with FXTAS (4 women, 18 men) 
and proposed to add CCS hyperintensity 
as a new major radiologic criterion for FXTAS. 
Subsequently, 
Renaud et al., 2015 [@RenaudMathilde2015Rocc] 
confirmed the finding from Apartis et al., 2012 
and further reported that the combination of CCS and MCP hyperintensity 
was more common in FXTAS than in other neurodegenerative disorders; 
e.g.,
multiple system atrophy of the cerebellar type, 
Parkinson's disease,  
Alzheimer's disease. 
A third study addressing the prevalence of CCS in FXTAS 
compared 15 men and 7 women with FXTAS
to 15 male and 7 female controls [@HallDeborahA.2017TCCS]. 
This study showed that the CCS sign occurred more frequently 
in men with FXTAS compared with controls 
but not in women with FXTAS.
Compared with the MCP sign, 
the CCS sign showed higher sensitivity but lower specificity in 
both men and women with FXTAS.
Schneider et al. 2020 [@schneider2020women]
found that the white matter hyperintensity of the CCS was seen 
in 34 of 53 women with FXTAS
and in only 2 of 55 age-matched control women 
and was the most common MRI abnormality in females with FXTAS.
