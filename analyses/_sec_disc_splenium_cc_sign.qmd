Although no neuropathological studies have examined the splenium of the corpus callosum (CCS), 
several in vivo MRI studies have reported signal changes in the CCS in patients with FXTAS. 
Apartis et al., 2012 [@apartis2012fxtas] 
was the first study reporting that CCS hyperintensity occurred 
as frequently as middle cerebellar peduncle (MCP) hyperintensity 
in 22 patients with FXTAS (4 women, 18 men) 
and proposed to add CCS hyperintensity as a new major radiologic criterion for FXTAS. 
Subsequently, 
Renaud et al., 2014 [@RenaudMathilde2015Rocc] 
confirmed the finding from Apartis et al., 
and further reported that the combination of CCS and MCP hyperintensity 
was more common in FXTAS than in other neurodegenerative disorders; 
namely, 
multiple system atrophy of cerebellar type, 
Parkinson's disease, and 
Alzheimer's disease. 
In the third study addressing the prevalence of CCS in FXTAS compared 15 men and 7 women with FXTAS,
to 15 male and 7 female controls [@HallDeborahA.2017TCCS]. 
This study showed that the CCS sign occurred more frequently in men with FXTAS compared with controls but not in women with FXTAS.
Compared with the MCP sign, 
the CCS sign showed higher sensitivity in men and women with FXTAS, 
but lower specificity in both men and women with FXTAS. 
The Schneider et al. 20202 paper 
about women with FXTAS [@schneider2020women]
found that the white matter hyperintensity of the CCS was seen 
in 34/53 of these women 
and in only 2/55 age matched control women 
and was the most common MRI abnormality in females with FXTAS.
