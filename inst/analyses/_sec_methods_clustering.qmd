We also fitted the model on the full dataset (not stratified by sex or CGG)
for 2 - `r N_S_max` latent subtypes,
each with their own ordering.
We determined the optimal number of latent subtypes for this dataset using
the Cross-Validation Information Criterion (CVIC)
and the Out-Of-Fold Log-Likelihood (OOFLL) criterion [@young2018uncovering];
both criteria quantify how well models containing a given number of subtypes
extend to new data not used in training.
We performed `r N_CV_folds`-fold cross-validation on the unstratified data
and calculated the CVIC and OOFLL for 1-`r N_S_max` latent subtypes.
