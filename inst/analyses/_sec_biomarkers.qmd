We analyzed measurements of 
`r length(biomarker_levels)` ordinal `r outcomes_name`s,
each with 
between two and `r max_levels |> xfun::numbers_to_words()` levels, 
listed in @tbl-biomarker-list.
Herein the term "`r outcomes_name`s" refers to 
a broad range of medical signs 
or indications of medical state 
observed from patients.
Each "clinically elevated" ordinal level 
(above the first-listed, reference level) 
constitutes an outcome event 
in the disease progression modelling analysis 
(see [Statistical analysis](#sec-Statistical-analysis)).
Abbreviations used in `r outcomes_name` names
are listed in @tbl-abbrevs.
