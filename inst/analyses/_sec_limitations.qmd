This study has several limitations.
In the subtype clustering analysis,
it was challenging to concisely summarize
the differences between subtypes,
especially given the relatively small sample sizes per subtype
(@suppfig-stage-barplot_chosen_subtypes)
and the correspondingly large amounts of uncertainty
in their event orderings
(@suppfig-pvd_chosen_subtypes).
Larger sample sizes would enable us to 
precisely estimate models with more stratifying variables. 
In particular, the current dataset consists of 
60% males and 40% females among premutation carriers
(@suppfig-stage-barplot-by-sex). 
The ongoing recruitment for the GP study focuses on recruiting more females, 
which will help add precision to models for females and rare events 
in the future.
We had substantial amounts of missing data.
As described in the methods ([Imputation of missing data](#sec-incomplete-data)),
we used the marginal distribution of
the observed data for each `r outcomes_name` among cases
to impute the underlying values of these missing data.
The missing data could contribute to uncertainty in the results.
Our data contained both continuous and ordinal variables.
In order to apply the Ordinal SuStaIn algorithm,
we categorized some `r outcomes_name`s
that were originally measured as continuous values.
In doing so, we likely sacrificed some granular information.
There are other variations of the SuStaIn algorithm,
such as z-score SuStaIn [@young2018uncovering],
which are designed to be used with only continuous measurements.
Further development is warranted to combine Ordinal SuStaIn and z-score SuStaIn
to fit an event-based model with both continuous and ordinal data.

Our data come from the GP and TRAX studies,
which are longitudinal cohort studies
with infrequent follow-up visits.
These studies do not collect precise information
about timing of symptom onsets,
particularly for historical symptoms,
so it is not feasible to use the time-to-event data
to confirm the results from the Ordinal SuStaIn analysis.
In our analysis approach,
the event onsets are not modeled as a function of participant age;
instead, 
each event's onset timing is only modeled relative to the other events 
using control participant information as reference.
Therefore, the sequence differences between the subtypes
are all in relative terms:
if one event moves earlier in the sequence
when comparing one subtype to another,
other events are pushed later in the sequence,
even if only one event timing
changes relative to age.
Additional research including longitudinal data
collecting precise ages of onset
would be needed to verify our findings.

The data used in this analysis came from patients and controls 
who participated in longitudinal studies at 
the UC Davis MIND Institute
and may not be directly generalizable to other diverse populations.
The participants predominantly reported
their primary race/ethnicity as "White",
and we did not have data from enough patients with other
diverse racial/ethnic identities to accurately estimate
stratified models by race/ethnicity.
A larger study including a more diverse set of participants 
is warranted to support analyses with increased external validity.
