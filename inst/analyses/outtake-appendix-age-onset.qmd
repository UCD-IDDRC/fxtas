### Age of onset {.appendix}

In the RedCap database, the "age of onset" variables were recorded using a mix of precise ages and decade-long ranges (for example, "`130`" = "teens", "`200`" = "twenties", etc.). For analysis as numeric variables, the decade codes were replaced by their midpoints (for example, "`130`" was replaced with 15, "`200`" with 25, etc.). The exception is code "`555`" = "lifelong", which was replaced by the minimum of 10 years and the smallest observed value for that age-of-onset variable; for example, if the smallest observed value for "age of tremor onset" was 8, then "`555`" would be replaced by 8. If the smallest observed value were 11, then "`555`" would be replaced by 10.
