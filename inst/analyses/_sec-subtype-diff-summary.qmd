Using the FXTAS Stage transitions as reference points,
we explored the differences in the appearing symptoms
relative to these FXTAS Stage transitions.
Roughly speaking:
Subtype 1 appeared to experience
white matter disease phenotypes earlier 
(before FXTAS Stage 1)
compared to the other subtypes.
Subtype 2 appeared to experience 
early intermittent tremors and intention tremors 
(before FXTAS Stage 1).
Subtypes 1 and 2 appeared to experience 
memory impairment (as assessed by SWM)
prior to FXTAS Stage 1,
earlier than Subtypes 3 and 4
who appeared to experience memory impairment
between FXTAS Stages 3-4.
Subtypes 1 and 2
might be described as "memory-early."
Subtype 3 appeared to experience
early ataxia
(between FXTAS Stages 1 and 2)
and tremor onsets
(between FXTAS Stages 1 and 3).
This subtype had the fewest participants, 
and may represent a mixture of smaller latent subtypes and/or
include outlier individuals with unusual event sequences.
Subtype 4 appeared to have later onset of the included symptoms,
with none prior to FXTAS Stage 1.
