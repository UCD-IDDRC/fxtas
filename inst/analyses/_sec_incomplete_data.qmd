We assumed that missing `r outcomes_name` data
were missing at random (MAR)
[@rubin1976inference, @little2019statistical].
As the longitudinal cohorts evolved over time,
new instruments were adopted and added;
much of the missingness was due to
adding additional measures to the study protocols in later time.
The MAR assumption thus seems plausible.
We substituted missing outcome event data
by assigning a probability distribution across the
possible values of the missing variable
that matched the marginal distribution of observed data
among the cases.
For example,
`r n_missing` of the `r length(x1)` cases (`r pct_missing`)
had missing values for ataxia severity,
and `r n_obs` (`r pct_obs`) had recorded values,
distributed among ataxia severity levels 0-4
(`r v1_usable_cases$"ataxia severity*" |> counts_and_pcts() |> and::and()`,
respectively).
For the `r n_missing` cases with missing values,
we assigned probabilities of `r probs |> and::and()`
to ataxia severity levels `r 0:4 |> and::and()`, respectively,
and missing values were imputed under the marginal distribution
of the observed data.
