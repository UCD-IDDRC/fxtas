We applied a discrete event-based disease progression model 
[@fonteijn2011event; @fonteijn2012event; @oxtoby2023data] 
to our data using 
the Ordinal Subtype and Stage Inference ("SuStaIn") algorithm 
[@young2021ordinal] 
to estimate event orderings and subtypes for FXTAS patients. 
SuStaIn is a data-driven statistical modeling algorithm 
that combines 
event-based disease progression modelling 
[@fonteijn2011event; @fonteijn2012event; @oxtoby2023data]
and latent-cluster finite mixture modeling 
[@pearson1894contributions; 
@lazarsfeld1950logical; 
@mclachlan2019finite] 
to model event sequences 
using cross-sectional samples of patient and control populations. 
The algorithm simultaneously 
clusters individuals into latent subtypes and 
characterizes the event ordering that best defines each subtype, 
thus capturing heterogeneity 
in both disease subtype and disease stage.

Ordinal SuStaIn [@young2021ordinal] is 
a version of the SuStaIn modeling algorithm [@young2018uncovering],
adapted for analyzing ordinal-valued data.
Ordinal SuStaIn uses a "scored events model", 
which assumes that for each `r outcomes_name`,
there is a discrete set of 
underlying ordinal severity levels,
but the measured versions of the `r outcomes_name`s may contain 
some amount of random noise.
For example, a patient who was really at ataxia severity level 2 
may be incorrectly assessed as being at ataxia severity level 1, 
depending on 
the patient's temporary disease status on the day of the exam 
or inter-rater differences.
The first step in applying the Ordinal SuStaIn algorithm is 
to determine, for each `r outcomes_name`, 
the probability that an individual is 
"correctly scored" at their "true underlying level" 
[@young2021ordinal].
Following the procedures proposed in the original SuStaIn methodology papers
[@young2018uncovering; @young2021ordinal],
we used the distributions of symptoms observed among the controls 
to estimate the rates at which premutation carriers experience symptoms 
and we thus estimated the percentages of FXTAS-related symptoms 
(i.e., the proportion of symptoms due to FXTAS among premutation carriers) 
as the percentage of controls 
who were assessed as being at the reference level
(@supptbl-prob-correct).
We limited the estimated probability of correct scoring to 
`r max_prob_correct *100`%
in order to allow for a plausible probability of symptoms 
unrelated to FXTAS progression.

Ordinal SuStaIn then uses 
Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling [@gelfand1990sampling]
to estimate the Bayesian posterior probability of 
each possible event sequence 
for each subtype given the training dataset, 
assuming a uniform prior distribution 
over the set of all possible orderings. 
We conducted subgroup analyses by fitting models stratified by
sex (section 
[Sex differences in sequential orders](#sec-methods-strat-sex)), 
CGG repeats (<100 vs ≥100) 
(Supplementary material, Analyses stratified by CGG repeats),
and combinations of sex and CGG repeats (<100 vs ≥100) 
(Supplementary material, Comparing sexes stratified by CGG level).
In these subgroup analyses, we did not search for latent clusters.
