To study whether observed sex differences were modulated by CGG repeats,
we conducted subgroup analyses by CGG repeat size.
A statistically significant difference between males and females
was found among those with lower CGG repeats < 100
(p = `r pval_under100_sex_gp34_v1`;
@suppfig-pvd-by-gender-cgg_under100-1),
while a difference between males and females
was not statistically significant
among those with higher CGG repeats â‰¥ 100
(p = `r pval_over100_sex_gp34_v1`;

).
Several psychiatric disorders (as assessed by SCID)
occurred prior to FXTAS Stage 1
among females with < 100 CGG repeats,
but at later FXTAS stages for males with < 100 CGG repeats
(@suppfig-pvd-by-gender-cgg_under100-2).
MRI biomarkers appeared to occur at later stages in females compared to males.
