@suppfig-stage-by-age shows estimated disease progression stage
(that is, number of events experienced)
by age at visit and estimated latent subtype,
with a
Locally Estimated Scatterplot Smoothing (LOESS)
non-parametric regression curve superimposed [@cleveland1992local].
This graph is a model diagnostic; if the model fits the data well,
then older patients should on average be classified as being farther
along in their disease progression, resulting in an upwards trend.
Types 1, 3 and 4 appear to show such an upwards trend.
Type 2 has a less clear trend, but does not show substantial evidence
of lack of fit.
In all four subtypes, patients whose visit occurred at a later age
tend to be at a later estimated stage of disease progression.
The upwards trend of progression stage with age
indicates that the estimated models are plausible.
