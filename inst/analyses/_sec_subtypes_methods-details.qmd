The Ordinal SuStaIn algorithm clusters observations into subgroups
based on their shared compatibility with particular event sequences.
As a simplified example,
if participants A, B, and C all had experienced ataxia but no tremors
by the time when they were assessed for the study,
and participants D, E, and F had all experienced tremors but not ataxia,
then participants A, B, and C would be grouped as a subgroup cluster
in which ataxia precedes tremor,
and participants D, E, and F would be clustered into
a “tremor before ataxia” subgroup.
If participants G, H, and I displayed
both ataxia and tremors at the time of assessment,
then the Ordinal SuStaIn algorithm might be
unable to confidently determine which latent subgroup they belonged to,
at least on the basis of these two symptoms.
However, their other symptoms help the algorithm refine the clustering.
On the other hand,
if participants J, K, and L displayed neither ataxia nor tremors,
they would also not be classified into
either of the two clusters described above
and would be assigned to a new cluster “Subgroup 0”,
representing individuals whose disease has not yet begun to progress
by the time when they were assessed for the study.

To cluster observations in a given data set into latent subtypes
using the Ordinal SuStaIn modeling algorithm,
we determined the optimal number of clusters based on 
the Cross-Validation Information Criterion (CVIC)
described in Young et al. [-@young2018uncovering].
We also evaluated the consistency of our cross-validation procedure
by looking at the distribution of
out-of-fold log-likelihood ("OOFLL")
across cross-validation folds
(Young et al. [-@young2018uncovering]).
[Supplementary Fig. @suppfig-cvic-2] shows
the distribution of the OOFLL statistic
as a function of number of latent subgroups.
