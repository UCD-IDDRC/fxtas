The apparent discrepancy is due to different proportions of missing data;
`r parkinsons_na_pct`% of the “Parkinson's disease” variable is missing,
whereas `r pf_na_pct`% of the “parkinsonian features” variable is missing.
Parkinson's disease diagnoses were made by
the participants' primary physicians or neurologists,
outside of the GP and TRAX studies,
whereas parkinsonian features were assessed as part of the study protocols.
