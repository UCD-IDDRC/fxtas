The goal of `fxtas` is to apply the Ordinal SuStaIn algorithm (@young2021ordinal)
to study disease progression in Fragile X Syndrome,  
as described in Morrison et al (not yet published), "Event sequences in Fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome".

## Installation

You can install the development version of fxtas from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("d-morrison/fxtas")
```

## Running the analyses

The manuscript *Event sequences in Fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome* is implemented in the file `ordinal-sustain.qmd` 
in the `vignettes/articles` subfolder, 
which incorporates several subfiles in this repository.
The `data-raw` folder contains numerous auxiliary scripts, including:

* data preprocessing scripts, which be run in the following order (after extracting the necessary files from the GP, GP4, and Trax research databases):
    - `gp3.r`
    - `gp4.r`
    - `gp34.R`
    - `trax.R`

* [SLURM](https://slurm.schedmd.com/documentation.html)
batch scripts and corresponding R scripts 
for pre-running the computation-heavy sections of the analysis
on an appropriately-preconfigured distributed computing server.
    - If the corresponding output files have not been pre-generated, 
        `ordinal-sustain.qmd` should produce them
