### Composite variables {#sec-composites .appendix}

#### Any autoimmune disorder {.appendix #sec-any-autoimmune}

Due to the rare nature of individual autoimmune diseases, a composite 
variable (`"any autoimmune disorder"`) was created for analysis: 
`"Yes"` if a patient had any of Lupus, Rheumatoid arthritis, 
Multiple Sclerosis, ANA positive, Sjogren's Syndrome, Raynaud's Syndrome, 
or Pulmonary Fibrosis; otherwise, 
`"No"` for no autoimmune diseases recorded.

#### MRI variables {#sec-mri-composites}

The MRI variables are combined into composite variables 
taking the most severe score within a brain region.

- "MRI Cerebellar" was composited as the most severe score of 
Cerebellar atrophy, 
Cerebellar WM hyperintensity, and 
MCP-WM hyperintensity.

- "MRI Cerebral" was composited as the most severe score of 
Cerebral atrophy, 
Cerebral WM hyperintensity,
Pons-WM hyperintensity, 
Sub-insular WM hyperintensity, and
Periventricular WM hyperintensity.  

- Splenium-WM hyperintensity,
Genu-WM hyperintensity, and 
Corpus Callosum-Thickness 
remain as separate fields,
because they had been coded using
incompatible Likert scales.

#### SCID composite variables {#sec-scid-composites}

Similarly, we combined individual SCID disorders into composite variables,
taking the highest level ("Absent", "Sub-Threshold", or "Threshold") 
among the constituent individual disorders.
