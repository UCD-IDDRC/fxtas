### Composite variables {#sec-composites .appendix}

#### `"any autoimmune disorder"` {.appendix}

Due to the rare nature of the individual autoimmune diseases, a composite 
variable (`"any autoimmune disorder"`) was created for analysis. 
`"any autoimmune disorder"` was set to `"Yes"` if a patient had Lupus, Rheumatoid arthritis, 
Multiple Sclerosis, ANA positive, Sjogren's Syndrome, Raynaud's Syndrome, 
or Pulmonary Fibrosis; otherwise, it was set to `"No"`.

#### SCID composite variables

Similarly, we combined individual SCID disorders into composite variables,
taking the highest level ("Absent", "Sub-Threshold", or "Threshold") 
among the constituent individual disorders.
Specifically:

`SCID: Mood Disorders` combines:

- "Bipolar I Disorder (MD01), Lifetime" 
- "Bipolar II Disorder (MD02), Lifetime"
- "Other Bipolar Disorder (MD03), Lifetime" 
- "Major Depressive Disorder (MD04), Lifetime"
- "Dysthymic Disorder (MD05), Lifetime"
- "Depressive Disorder NOS (MD06), Lifetime"
- "Mood Disorder Due to GMC (MD07), Lifetime" 
- "Substance-Induced Mood Dis. (MD08), Lifetime"

`"SCID: Substance Use Disorders"` combines:

- "Alcohol (SUD17), Lifetime" 
- "Sedative-Hypnotic-Anxiolytic (SUD18), Lifetime"
- "Cannabis (SUD19), Lifetime"
- "Stimulants (SUD20), Lifetime"
- "Opiod (SUD21), Lifetime"
- "Cocaine (SUD22), Lifetime"
- "Hallucinogenics/ PCP (SUD23), Lifetime"
- "Poly Drug (SUD24), Lifetime"
- "Other (SUD25), Lifetime"

`SCID: Anxiety Disorders` combines:

- "Panic Disorder (ANX26), Lifetime"
- "Agoraphobia without Panic (ANX27), Lifetime"
- "Social Phobia (ANX28), Lifetime"
- "Specific Phobia (ANX29), Lifetime"
- "Obsessive Compulsive (ANX30), Lifetime"
- "Posttraumatic Stress (ANX31), Lifetime"
- "Generalized Anxiety (ANX32), Current Only"
- "Anxiety Due to GMC (ANX33), Lifetime"
- "Substance-Induced Anxiety (ANX34), Lifetime"
- "Anxiety Disorder NOS (ANX35), Lifetime"

`SCID: Somatization Disorders` combines:

- "Somatization Disorder (SOM36)"
- "Pain Disorder (SOM37)"
- "Undifferentiated Somatoform (SOM38)"
- "Body Dysmorphic (SOM40)"
- "Hypochondriasis (SOM39)"

(`SCID: Psychotic Symptoms` is not a composite variable; instead, it is simply a shortened label for "Primary Psychotic Symptoms (PS01), Lifetime".)
