The fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) is a
neurodegenerative disorder caused by the
premutation (55 to 200 CGG repeats) in the *FMR1* gene.
An open question is:
In what sequential order do
FXTAS symptoms typically appear,
and how does that sequence vary
among participants and
between males and females?
Here, we applied the
ordinal-outcomes version of the
Subtype and Stage Inference algorithm ("Ordinal SuStaIn") to
identify the sequential events of
clinical and brain MRI changes
in observed data
collected in FXTAS patients.
We found
substantial differences in order of events
depending on sex and CGG repeat number.
