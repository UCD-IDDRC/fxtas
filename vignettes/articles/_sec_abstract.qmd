The fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) is a
neurodegenerative disorder caused by the
premutation (55 to 200 CGG repeats) in the *FMR1* gene.
An open question is:
In what sequential order do
FXTAS symptoms typically appear,
and how does that sequence vary
among participants and
between males and females?
Here, we applied the
ordinal-outcomes version of the
Subtype and Stage Inference algorithm ("Ordinal SuStaIn") to
identify the sequential events of
clinical and brain MRI changes
in observed data
collected in FXTAS patients of stage 0-5.
We included `r length(biomarker_varnames)` neurodegenerative symptoms 
collected from `r nrow(v1_usable_cases)` premutation carriers 
and `r nrow(controls_v1)` controls 
(aged `r min(v1_usable$"Age at visit")` - `r max(v1_usable$"Age at visit") |> round()`
years old at entry; 
`r nrow(v1_usable_males)` males 
and `r nrow(v1_usable_females)` females) 
who participated in two longitudinal studies,
with entry dates between `r min_year` - `r max_year`.
We found
substantial differences in order of events
depending on sex,
and possibly in combination of sex and CGG repeats.
The main finding is 
the predominance of the psychiatric problems that occur early in females 
and often before the onset of tremor and ataxia compared to males. 
Females appear to experience early cognitive problems 
involving executive dysfunction and memory 
in comparison to males. 
This finding suggests that the diagnostic criteria for FXTAS 
is different in females compared to males, 
particularly for early symptoms in disease development and progression.
