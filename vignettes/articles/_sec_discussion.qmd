The present study attempted to arrange the eventual symptoms of FXTAS
in their possible appearing sequential orders
and determine risk factors that impact on the
sequential order of presentation among individuals.
The main findings of this analysis were
substantial differences in sequential order of eventual symptoms
between males and females
and in combination of sex and CGG repeat size.

The proportions of
lifetime anxiety disorders,
mood disorders,
and somatoform disorders in this study cohort
is far more than
[Clinicians: please provide a reference for comparison]{.comment-start author="Ezra Morrison"}
usual population expectations for these illnesses
[]{.comment-end}.
This study design did not fractionate specific lifetime psychiatric illnesses
(e.g., major depressive disorder, panic disorder, and somatization disorder),
but these overall lifetime prevalence figures are notable.
[Clinicians: please provide a reference]{.comment-start author="Ezra Morrison"}
Prior studies of mood and anxiety disorders
[]{.comment-end}
have demonstrated a higher than expected rate of these illnesses
in premutation carriers.
The same increase lifetime psychiatric illness burden
[Clinicians: please provide a reference]{.comment-start author="Ezra Morrison"}
is seen in other neurodegenerative illnesses
(e.g., Parkinson’s disease, multiple sclerosis).
[]{.comment-end}
While many psychiatric illness have a strong genetic predisposition,
the lifetime prevalences here persuasively suggest that
the premutation carrier state itself increases the risk of psychiatric illness.
As the SCID assesses lifetime illness risk,
it is probable that the index episode of psychiatric illness
antedated the onset of
tremor,
ataxia, and
major neurocognitive disorder
seen in more advanced premutation conditions like FXTAS.
As such, the high lifetime burden of psychiatric illness in this population
cannot be plausible attributed solely (perhaps substantially) to
an “emotional reaction”
to the loss of function associated with these functional impairments,
but rather should be understood as a component of the premutation carrier state itself.
It is likely that this intrinsic vulnerability to psychiatric illness
is a significant component of the carrier state.
Furthermore, as only a small proportion of the patients
had MMSE scores in the impaired range,
it is also unlikely that the high rates of
depressive, anxiety (and other) psychiatric illness
could be attributed to complications of FXTAS dementia,
as the majority of subjects had normal MMSE scores,
which would not be consistent with dementia.
For example, depressive disorders
are a common psychiatric complication of dementia,
but few of the depressive disorders found here could be attributed to dementia.
A common sequence of illnesses seen clinically in carriers is
depressive and/or anxiety disorders with adult onset,
then tremor and ataxia in the 40s,
followed by FXTAS dementia in the 60s.
Seen in this light, and knowing the ultimate CNS vulnerability of the carrier state,
retrospectively the initial presentation of depressive and/or anxiety disorders
could be regarded as a psychiatric prodrome of later full spectrum illness.
This is analogous to the psychotic illness seen in SLE before rheumatologic findings
and the depressive disorder that is commonly seen
in the 5 years before the motor signs leading to a diagnosis of multiple sclerosis.

This data shows more significant involvement in males than females, as predicted,
but a remarkable finding is the predominance of the psychiatric problems
that occur early in females
and often before the onset of tremor and ataxia compared to the males.
These symptoms, particularly mood disorders,
can often occur even before the diagnosis of FXTAS in the females,
and the stress involved with mood disorders may be a precipitating feature
for the onset of FXTAS.
In addition, females may exerience early cognitive problems,
particularly involving executive dysfunction and memory,
as seen by the SWM and PAL scores that occur early on in the females.
From a clinical perspective,
we have seen significant psychiatric problems
leading into some cognitive deficits in memory and EF abilities,
but these females may not meet the criteria of FXTAS diagnosis,
because of the absence of significant tremor and/or ataxia.
However, if white matter disease emerges on MRI particularly in the splenium
or in the periventricular area,
then this demonstrates the onset of the neuropathology of FXTAS,
even if there is no tremor or ataxia yet.
This suggests that the diagnostic criteria for FXTAS
is different in females compared to males,
particularly for early cases.
The diagnostic criteria for FXTAS was determined with the study of males only
[@jacquemont2003fragile].
Subsequent criteria for the diagnosis of FXTAS was modified [@hall2014emerging]
to include the involvement of the splenium,
which is seen in the majority of females with FXTAS
[@apartis2012fxtas; @schneider2020women].
Hall *et al.* [-@hall2014emerging] also added
the feature of neuropathy,
which occurs in the majority of FXTAS patients,
but it is a common finding in the elderly with many causes,
so it is just a minor criteria for FXTAS.
Although the diagnostic criteria have been modified somewhat for the females,
there may be subsequent changes in the early stages of FXTAS
as further follow-up studies are able to separate
the psychiatric problems in females seen early on here
from more significant neuropathology associated with
extended features of FXTAS over time.
As new treatments for FXTAS develop,
the earlier the diagnosis,
the more likely the treatment will be effective.

When we compared
between 55-99 vs 100-199 CGG repeats in males and females combined,
no significant difference was found
(p = `r pval_cgg_gp34_v1`)
(@suppfig-pvd-by-cgg).
The finding of only minimal differences
between 55-99 vs 100-199 CGG repeats is surprising,
since several studies have found that the higher the CGG repeats,
the earlier the onset and the faster the progression of FXTAS
[@greco2006neuropathology; @leehey2008fmr1; @tassone2023insight].
Perhaps the cut off of 100 is too high for this distinction to be made.

This study has several limitations.
In the subtype clustering analysis,
it was challenging to concisely summarize
the differences between subtypes,
especially given the relatively small sample sizes per subtype
and the correspondingly large amounts of uncertainty
in their event orderings.
We had substantial amounts of missing data.
As described in the methods (@sec-incomplete-data),
we used the marginal distribution of
the observed data for each `r outcomes_name` among cases
to impute the underlying values of these missing data.
The missing data could contribute to uncertainty in the results.
Our data contained both continuous and ordinal variables.
In order to apply the Ordinal SuStaIn algorithm,
we categorized some `r outcomes_name`s
that were originally measured as continuous values.
In doing so, we likely sacrificed some granular information.
There are other variations of the SuStaIn algorithm,
such as z-score SuStaIn [@young2018uncovering],
which are designed to be used with only continuous measurements.
Further development is warranted to combine Ordinal SuStaIn and z-score SuStaIn
to fit an event-based model with both continuous and ordinal data.
Our data come from the GP and Trax studies,
which are longitudinal cohort studies
with infrequent followup visits.
These studies do not collect precise information
about timing of symptom onsets,
so it is not feasible to use the longitudinal data
to confirm the results from the Ordinal SuStaIn analysis.
In our analysis approach,
the event onsets are not modeled as a function of participant age;
instead, each event's onset timing is only modeled relative to the other events.
Therefore, the sequence differences between the subtypes
are all in relative terms:
if one event moves earlier in the sequence
when comparing one subtype to another,
other events are pushed later in the sequence,
even if only one event timing
changes relative to age.
Additional research including longitudinal data
collecting precise ages of onset
would be needed to verify our findings.
