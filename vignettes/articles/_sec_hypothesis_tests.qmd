To test for statistical significant evidence of differences
in event sequences
between males and females
and between lower (CGG <100)
and higher premutation levels (CGG 100-199),
we implemented a permutation test [@welch1990construction]
to calculate a p-value that is
the probability of observing a difference
at least as extreme as the test statistic
given that the null hypothesis of no difference is true.
We first created `r n_permutations` permuted datasets
in which we randomly shuffled the variable being tested.
We computed the mean log-likelihood of the data
for each permuted dataset
(averaging across MCMC samples and
summing across the strata being compared)
and compared
the distribution of permuted mean log-likelihoods
to the observed log-likelihood
calculated from the original (unpermuted) dataset.
We computed the empirical p-value
by first computing the percentile of
the observed mean log-likelihood
relative to the empirical distribution of
the permuted mean log-likelihoods,
subtracting that percentile from 1 if larger than 0.5,
and then multiplying by two to calculate a two-sided test statistic.
We declared significance if the p-value was less than or equal to 0.05.
