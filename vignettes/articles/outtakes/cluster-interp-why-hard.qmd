With `r n_events` symptoms included in the analysis,
it is challenging to concisely summarize the differences between subtypes,
especially given the relatively small sample sizes per subtype
and the correspondingly large amounts of uncertainty in their event orderings.
In this analysis approach,
the event onsets are not modeled as a function of participant age;
instead, each event's onset timing is only modeled relative to the other events.
Therefore, the sequence differences between the subtypes
are all in relative terms:
if one event moves earlier in the sequence
when comparing one subtype to another,
other events are pushed later in the sequence,
even if only one event timing
changes relative to age.
In order to provide clearer clinical interpretation,
