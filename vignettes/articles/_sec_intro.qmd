The fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) is a
neurodegenerative disorder caused by the
premutation (55 to 200 CGG repeats) in the
fragile X messenger ribonucleoprotein (*FMR1*) gene [@hagerman2001intention].
The premutation is associated with
elevation of the *FMR1* mRNA 
[

This elevation leads to
RNA toxicity including
oxidative stress,
mitochondrial dysfunction,
calcium dysregulation, and
sequestration of proteins important to neuronal function.

Proteins and neurofilaments sequester with the excess *FMR1* mRNA,
leading to the formation of
eosinophilic, tau-negative intranuclear inclusions
in neurons and astrocytes throughout the CNS and
in the peripheral nervous system (PNS) [@greco2006neuropathology; @hunter2012capturing].
FXTAS *usually* begins in the 60s,
though some patients have an earlier onset.
As premutation carriers age,
the prevalence of FXTAS increases from approximately
40% in males in their 60s to
75% in their 80s [@jacquemont2004penetrance].
Females with the premutation are also at risk for FXTAS,
but the prevalence is lower;
approximately 20% may develop FXTAS,
and it is usually less severe than in males [@tassone2023insight].
In general,
the higher the CGG repeat number within the premutation range,
the earlier onset of FXTAS,
and earlier death [@greco2006neuropathology].
The prevalence of the premutation is estimated at
one in 148 to 200 females and
one in 290 to 855 males
in the general population [@maenner2013fmr1; @hunter2014epidemiology].

The symptoms of FXTAS appear and develop over years in adulthood, 
usually after age 50. 
The symptoms of FXTAS include 
tremors, 
gait ataxias, 
neuropathy, 
cognitive decline, 
mood instability, 
and others
[@hagerman2001intention]. 
Both the type and severity of FXTAS symptoms vary among individuals. 
Some patients with FXTAS have multiple symptoms that progress rapidly 
and others have few symptoms that remain mild over many years. 
However, the appearing sequence of those symptoms is still understudied. 
Therefore, the present study attempts to address the following questions:
1) In what sequential order do FXTAS symptoms and brain changes typically appear;
2) how does that sequence vary among participants;
and 3) do specific baseline characteristics predict the order of presentation?
Here, we applied the ordinal-outcomes version of the
Subtype and Stage Inference algorithm
("Ordinal SuStaIn") [@young2018uncovering; @young2021ordinal]
to model event sequential orders of apparent FXTAS symptoms
in a cohort of FXTAS patients.
SuStaIn is a data-driven analytic approach
which was originally developed to
analyze cross-sectional biomarker data
to simultaneously
(1) estimate the ordering of onset 
for biomarkers of disease progression events and
(2) cluster study participants into 
latent subtypes with different event orderings.
The SuStaIn modeling approach has been applied to
Alzheimer's disease
[@young2018uncovering; @young2021ordinal; @vogel2021four; @collij2022spatial],
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis [@young2023data],
Parkinson's disease [@zhou2022two],
primary tauopathies [@scotton2023disease],
frontotemporal dementia [@young2018uncovering],
multiple sclerosis [@eshaghi2021identifying],
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) [@young2020disease],
and knee osteoarthritis [@li2021identifying],
but not previously for FXTAS.
We here apply it to a cross-sectional data set of
premutation carriers diagnosed with FXTAS of different stages
to study the sequential ordering of FXTAS symptomatic events.
