We analyzed measurements of 
`r length(biomarker_levels)` ordinal `r outcomes_name`s
with a total of `r sum(nlevs)` levels, 
listed in @tbl-biomarker-list.
Herein the term "`r outcomes_name`s" refers to 
a broad range of medical signs 
or indications of medical state 
observed from patients.
Each "clinically elevated" ordinal level 
(above the first-listed, reference level) 
constitutes an outcome event 
in the disease progression modelling analysis 
(@sec-Statistical-analysis).

We created a composite variable "any autoimmune disorder" combining
lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, 
multiple sclerosis, ANA positivity, Sjogren's syndrome, Raynaud's syndrome, 
and pulmonary fibrosis, 
since these conditions were too rare to analyze separately
(details in Supplementary Materials, @sec-any-autoimmune).
We also created composite variables for 
four domains of the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID-IV):
Mood Disorders, 
Substance Use Disorders, 
Anxiety Disorders, and 
Somatoform Disorders;
there were no participants with Psychotic Disorders in our data
(more details in Supplementary Materials, @sec-scid-composites).
We used the "Lifetime" variables from SCID-IV to construct these composites.
We also created composite variables for 
MRI variables for cerebral and cerebellar abnormalities detected via MRI;
we did not combine the variables representing corpus callosum MRI abnormalities,
since these variables were created using Likert scales that differed from each other
(details in Supplementary Materials, @sec-mri-composites).

[Supplementary Tables S -@supptbl-tremors] - [S -@supptbl-autoimmune] 
summarize each of the `r outcomes_name`s that we included in the analysis models, 
stratified by 
CGG repeat size (`r levels(v1_usable$"FX3*")`) 
and 
Sex (`r unique(v1_usable$Gender)`).
