@supptbl-prob-correct shows the estimated proportion of 
correctly scored individuals
for each `r outcomes_name`, [@young2021ordinal]
estimated using the controls data.

```{r}

```

**Proportions of controls at baseline levels, 
and corresponding estimates of 
probability of correct scoring.**
All controls are assumed to be truly 
at the reference levels for each symptom, 
and the proportion of correctly scored individuals 
is thus estimated as 
the proportion of controls 
who were assessed as being 
at the reference level.
