Research participants were recruited between `r min_year` and `r max_year`
for two longitudinal cohorts:
the Genotype-Phenotype Study in Fragile X Families
("GP"; funded by NICHD HD036071) and
the Trajectories and Markers of Neurodegeneration
in Fragile X Premutation Carriers study
("TRAX"; funded by NINDS NS110100).
The GP study includes males and females with FXTAS from ages 40-85 at entry,
and they are followed every 2 years
to document phenotypic progression over time.
