Research participants were recruited between `r min_year` and `r max_year`
for two longitudinal cohorts:
the Genotype-Phenotype Study in Fragile X Families
("GP"; funded by NICHD R01HD036071; PI Hagerman) and
the Trajectories and Markers of Neurodegeneration
in Fragile X Premutation Carriers study
("TRAX"; funded by NINDS NS110100; PI Rivera).
Written informed consent was obtained from all participants 
according to the procedures approved by the 
University of California, Davis Institutional Review Board.

The GP Study is a longitudinal research effort 
focused on adult male and female 
carriers of the fragile X premutation, 
aged 40-85 at entry, 
who have fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS). 
This study is conducted at the 
University of California, Davis MIND Institute 
and is supported by an NIH (NICHD) grant (#R01HD036071; PI Hagerman). 
Most participants have been recruited 
through the Fragile X Research and Treatment Center 
at the MIND Institute, 
including 
both family members 
already engaged with our clinical and research programs 
and new families who contacted us for 
clinical services 
or information about our research.
To be included in the study, 
participants must fall into one of the following categories:

1.	Premutation carriers with intellectual disabilities (IQ < 80) 
or a diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder (ASD)
(Autism, PDD-NOS, or Aspergerâ€™s syndrome).
2.	Premutation carriers without intellectual disabilities or ASD, 
who have a normal IQ and no psychiatric illness.
3.	Adult premutation carriers diagnosed with FXTAS.
4.	Control individuals without the fragile X premutation.

GP study participants are reassessed every two years
to document phenotypic progression over time.

The TRAX study is also conducted at the University of California, 
Davis MIND Institute. 
Participants in the TRAX longitudinal study include
67 male premutation carriers 
ranging from 40-82 years (mean: 60.2 years) 
and 32 male healthy controls 
ages 40-75 (mean: 57.7 years) at baseline visit. 
This study is also conducted at the 
University of California, Davis MIND Institute. 
An important goal of the recruitment process was 
the inclusion of premutation carriers 
who did not yet have a FXTAS diagnosis at enrollment. 
During telephone screening, 
detailed interviewing with potential participants 
suggested that none of the enrolled premutation carriers had FXTAS 
based upon the criteria of absence of tremor, ataxia, 
or any impairment in functioning. 
Despite the screening, 
11 of the 67 premutation carriers demonstrated 
at least equivocal/intermittent tremor and/or ataxia and 
functional interference (FXTAS Stage 2 or higher) at baseline visit
after neurological examination. 
Overall, 88 participants returned for 2-5 follow up visits 
over a total duration of 1 to 9 years (mean: 4.6 years) 
with varying intervals between visits averaging 2.5 years.
Of the participants without evidence of FXTAS at baseline 
who have had follow-up visits to date, 
28 subsequently developed FXTAS 
(tremor and/or ataxia and functional interference).

In both studies, 
each evaluation includes 
a detailed medical history, 
neurological examination, 
neuropsychological testing including the 
Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS IV), 
Behavior Dyscontrol Scale (BDS-2), 
Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE) and 
Cambridge Automated Neuropsychological Test Battery (CANTAB); 
Structured Clinical Interview for 
DSM-IV
Disorders 
(SCID-I/NP), 
motor testing, 
and brain MRI 
[@johnson2022fxtas_by_sex; 
@winarni2024apolipoproteine; 
@elias2024enlarged].
After the clinical and MRI evaluation,
each patient received a stage designation of FXTAS ranging from 0 to 6 
according to stages identified by Bacalman *et al.* @bacalman2006psychiatric  
based on tremor and ataxia severity. 
Stage 1 represents subclinical or uncertain tremor; 
Stage 2 is mild tremor without significant interference with 
activities of daily living (ADLs); 
Stage 3 is significant tremor that interferes with ADLs and significant ataxia; 
Stage 4 is significant ataxia needing a cane or walker;
Stage 5 is needing a wheelchair;
and Stage 6 is bedridden
(no participants at Stage 6 were included in these studies).

The primary sequence analysis of symptomatic events 
included baseline visit data 
from `r nrow(v1_usable)` participants from the GP and TRAX cohorts,
consisting of 
`r nrow(v1_usable_cases)` fragile X premutation carriers and 
`r nrow(controls_v1)` controls. 
@tbl-demographics provides 
demographic information about the study participants.
The controls' data were used to estimate 
the distribution of the analyzed `r outcomes_name`s 
among non-FXTAS individuals 
as reference in SuStaIn modeling
(more details in @sec-scored-events-model).
Then the cases' data were used to estimate FXTAS event sequences,
using the estimated control distributions to account for random variation
in observed symptoms unrelated to the underlying event sequence.
