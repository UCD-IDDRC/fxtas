Research participants were recruited between `r min_year` and `r max_year`
for two longitudinal cohorts:
the Genotype-Phenotype Study in Fragile X Families
("GP"; funded by NICHD R01HD036071; PI Hagerman) and
the Trajectories and Markers of Neurodegeneration
in Fragile X Premutation Carriers study
("TRAX"; funded by NINDS NS110100; PI Rivera).
Written informed consent was obtained from all participants 
according to the procedures approved by the 
University of California, Davis Institutional Review Board.

The GP Study is a longitudinal research effort 
focused on adult male and female carriers of the fragile X premutation, 
aged 40-85 at entry, 
who are affected by fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS). 
This study is conducted at the UC Davis MIND Institute 
and is supported by an NIH (NICHD) grant (#R01HD036071; PI Hagerman). 
Most participants have been recruited 
through the Fragile X Research and Treatment Center at the MIND Institute, 
including 
both family members already engaged with our clinical and research programs 
and new families 
who contacted us for clinical services or information about our research.
To be included in the study, 
participants must fall into one of the following categories:

1.	Premutation carriers with developmental challenges (IQ < 80) 
or a diagnosis of ASD (Autism, PDD-NOS, or Aspergerâ€™s syndrome).
2.	Premutation carriers without developmental issues or ASD, 
who have a normal IQ and no psychiatric diagnosis.
3.	Adult premutation carriers diagnosed with FXTAS.
4.	Control individuals without the fragile X premutation.

GP study participants are reassessed every 2 years
to document phenotypic progression over time.

Participants in the TRAX longitudinal study includes 
67 Male premutation carriers ranging from 40-82 years (Mean: 60.2 years) 
and 32 Male Healthy Controls ages 40-75 (Mean: 57.7 years) at baseline visit. 
This study is also conducted at the UC Davis MIND Institute. 
An important goal of the recruitment process was 
the inclusion of premutation carriers 
who do not yet have FXTAS diagnosis at enrollment. 
During phone screening, detailed interviewing with potential participants 
suggested than none of the enrolled premutation carriers had FXTAS 
based upon criterion of evidence of either tremor or ataxia 
with any degree of impairment in functioning. 
Despite the screening, 
11 of the 67 premutation carriers demonstrated 
at least equivocal/intermittent tremor and/or ataxia and 
functional interference (FXTAS Stage 2 or higher) at baseline visit
after neurological examination. 
Overall, 88 participants returned for 2-5 follow up visits 
over a total duration of 1 to 9 years (Mean: 4.6 years) 
with varying intervals averaging about 2.5 years apart.  
Of the participants without evidence of FXTAS at baseline 
who have follow-up visits to date, 
28 developed FXTAS 
(tremor and/or ataxia and functional interference).

In both studies, 
each evaluation includes 
a detailed medical history, 
neurological examination, 
neuropsychological testing including the 
WAIS IV, 
Behavior Dyscontrol Scale (BDS2), 
Mini Mental State Exam (MMSE) and 
Cambridge Automated Neuropsychological Test Battery (CANTAB); 
Structured Clinical Interview for 
DSM-[Is this correct?]{.comment-start author="Ezra Morrison"}IV[]{.comment-end} 
Disorders 
(SCID-IV), 
motor testing, 
and MRI assessment 
[@johnson2022fxtas_by_sex; 
@winarni2024apolipoproteine; 
@elias2024enlarged].
After the clinical and MRI evaluation,
each patient received a stage designation of FXTAS ranging from 0 to 6 
according to stages identified by @bacalman2006psychiatric  
focused on tremor and ataxia severity. 
Stage 1 represents subclinical or uncertain tremor; 
Stage 2 is mild tremor without significant interference with 
activities of daily living (ADLs); 
Stage 3 is significant tremor that interferes with ADLs and significant ataxia; 
Stage 4 is significant ataxia needing a cane or walker;
Stage 5 is needing a wheelchair;
and Stage 6 is bedridden
(no participants at Stage 6 were included in this study).
