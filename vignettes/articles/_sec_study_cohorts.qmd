Research participants were recruited between `r min_year` and `r max_year`
for two longitudinal cohorts:
the Genotype-Phenotype Study in Fragile X Families
("GP"; funded by NICHD HD036071; PI Hagerman) and
the Trajectories and Markers of Neurodegeneration
in Fragile X Premutation Carriers study
("TRAX"; funded by NINDS NS110100; PI Rivera).
The GP study includes males and females with FXTAS from ages 40-85 at entry,
and they are followed every 2 years
to document phenotypic progression over time.
The Trajectories study includes males 
with the premutation ages 40 through the 80s 
followed longitudinally with varying intervals averaging about 2.5 years apart. 
Most carriers enter the study with no evidence of FXTAS; 
approximately 25-30% developed the disease to date.

Each evaluation includes 
a detailed medical history, 
neurological examination, 
neuropsychological testing including the 
WAIS IV, 
Behavior Dyscontrol Scale (BDS2), 
Mini Mental State Exam (MMSE) and 
Cambridge Automated Neuropsychological Test Battery (CANTAB); 
Structured Clinical Interview for DSM Disorders (SCID), 
motor testing, 
and MRI assessment 
[@johnson2022fxtas_by_sex;

After the clinical and MRI evaluation,
each patient received a stage designation of FXTAS ranging from 0 to 5 
according to stages identified by @bacalman2006psychiatric  
focused on tremor and ataxia severity. 
Stage 1 represents subclinical or uncertain tremor; 
Stage 2 is mild tremor without significant interference with 
activities of daily living (ADLs); 
Stage 3 is significant tremor that interferes with ADLs and significant ataxia; 
Stage 4 is significant ataxia needing a cane or walker;
Stage 5 is needing a wheelchair;
and Stage 6 is bedridden.

Written informed consent was obtained from all participants 
according to the procedures approved by the 
University of California, Davis Institutional Review Board.
