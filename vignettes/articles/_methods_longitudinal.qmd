### Longitudinal subsets

We also fitted the Ordinal SuStaIn model, stratified by sex,
including all longitudinal repeated measurements
of the same participants over time
([Supplementary material, [Results with repeated measures](#sec-longitudinal-results)).
Including later observations
might help the model clarify the later stages of the event sequence.
However,
correlations between repeated observations of the same individuals
are not accounted for by the Ordinal SuStaIn model,
which assumes that all observations are statistically independent,
so we should note that including repeated measurements could lead to exaggerated estimates of precision.
